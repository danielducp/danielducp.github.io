        Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery is one of the city’s most historic buildings and is just a 2 minute walk from Queensgate Shopping Centre. The building contains interactive displays and galleries for all ages and the museum’s collection includes over 200,000 objects of great national and international importance. <br>

        There is always something new to see in our contemporary galleries showcase nationally and internationally renowned artists as well as talented local artists. Highlights in recent years have included 'A 64 Year Conversation about Art', the first ever exhibition to exhibit work by sculptor Sir Anthony Caro and painter Sheila Girling in the same space, 'Fabric of Society' a celebration of textile works created by women from different cultural communities in Peterborough and the Open Exhibition, a reoccuring art competition which allows any artist to submit work before 3 judges which, if successful, is showcased in a professional exhibition. <br>
        
        Squire’s Coffee House is always onhand if you fancy a bite to eat or a sit down. Entry to the museum is free (excluding advertised event days) - for an extra fun experience however, why not meet the ghosts of the museums past in The Priestgate Vaults or try and find your way out of our escape rooms in the cellars (in partnership with Escape Peterborough).<br>
