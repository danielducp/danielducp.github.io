      </h3>
      <p class="placestext">
        The name ‘Cresset’ refers to a basket of fire kept continuously alight and placed at the focal point of a
        medieval community. Around it, people gathered for their meetings and discussions; from it, they took fire to
        their own homes to provide heat and light. Like its namesake, The Cresset Theatre was designed to sit at the
        heart of the community, offering a wide range of services for local residents and visitors – and over 40 years
        after we opened our doors, we remain true to our original ethos of inclusion and community. <br>

        The unique concept for The Cresset – a community hub at the heart of Bretton, the first new township of Greater
        Peterborough – was devised in the 1970s by Sir Harold Haywood. The Cresset was developed and built by multiple
        organisations, including Peterborough City Council, Peterborough Development Corporation, Cambridgeshire County
        Council and several voluntary organisations. 1978 saw the official opening of this unique community complex by
        HM The Queen on 22nd March. The Queen attended with Prince Philip and toured the building, meeting staff,
        volunteers and clients before unveiling a commemorative plaque in The Cresset reception.
